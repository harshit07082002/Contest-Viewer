        Contest Viewer was started in August,2022 as an educational initiative
        for the programming community. It helps a person to get all the
        Competetive Programming Related Contest details at one Place.

        There was a vast need of this platform as many programmer who are
        interested in coding but couldnt give programming contest just because
        they dont know about or they forget. This App helps a person to view all
        the upcoming important contest at one place.

        We currently have only 3 websites link with us i.e{" "}
        <b>Codeforces, Codechef and Atcoder</b> but the goal is to link many
        more such Programming websites in the future.
